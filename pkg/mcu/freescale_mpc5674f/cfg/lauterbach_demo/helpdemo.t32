G1099325  H Training Simulator and Demo Software
G1113611  H Training Simulator and Demo Software
G1596050  X Version
G1723597  X 23-Apr-13 Revised manual with information for new users.
G1596052  H About the Demo
G1596056  X What is this? This is a guided tour through TRACE32 - a tutorial. We use a simple program example in C to illustrate the most important debug features, and give lots of helpful tips & tricks for everyday use. How long does this tutorial take? 0.5 to 1 hrs.
G1723411  X How can I learn most from this tutorial? Work completely through all chapters in sequence and then do the quiz at the end. Where can I download the TRACE32 Simulator for the hands-on debug session? From: http://www.lauterbach.com/download.html. You do not need any hardware for this tutorial.
G1595426  H Starting the TRACE32 Simulator
G1595590  X Unzip the downloaded file. You do not need to install the TRACE32 Simulator.
G1640047  X Double-click the t32m<architecture>.exe file (e.g. t32marm.exe) to start the demo debug session. When the TRACE32 Simulator starts, a start-up PRACTICE script that sets up a debug session is automatically executed.
G1596235  X You can manually execute the same start-up PRACTICE script by choosing File menu > Run Batchfile.
G1682908  X PRACTICE, the Lauterbach script language, is used for automating tests, configuring the TRACE32 GUI and your debug environment.
G1723749  X For our demo debug session, the PRACTICE start-up script armc.cmm loads the application program armle.axf and generates a TRACE32 internal symbol database out of the loaded information.
G1572803  H User Interface - TRACE32 PowerView
G1572813  X The graphical user interface (GUI) of TRACE32 is called TRACE32 PowerView, see screenshot below. Well briefly explain the GUI using the Data.List command and Data.List window as an example.
G1601777  H Program Listing and Program Counter
G1680875  X Do one of the following to open the Data.List window:
G1601922  X Choose View menu > List Source
G1602256  X or, at the TRACE32 command line, type: Data.List
G1602257  X The Data.List window displays the code in assembler mnemonic and HLL.
G1706356  X In the Data.List window, the gray bar indicates the position of the program counter (PC). Right now, it is located on the symbolic address of the label main. This is because the program counter (PC) is instructed in the start-up PRACTICE script, as follows:
G1706359  E ;Set CPU register Program Counter (PC) to the address of the label main.
G1706360  E Register.Set PC main
G1681723  H TRACE32 Commands
G1683107  X You can execute commands in TRACE32 PowerView via the usual suspects:
G1681724  X Menus on the menu bar
G1681725  X Buttons on the main toolbar and the buttons on the toolbars of TRACE32 windows
G1681727  X Context menus in TRACE32 windows
G1683098  X Additionally in TRACE32, you can execute commands via the TRACE32 command line and the softkeys below the command line.
G1683100  H TRACE32 Command Line and Softkeys
G1683101  X TRACE32 commands are not case sensitive:  register.view is the same as Register.view
G1680233  X UPPER CASE letters indicate the short forms of commands and must not be omitted. All lower case letters can be omitted. This makes short forms an efficient time saver when you are entering frequently-used commands in the command line. Examples:
G1662222  X Instead of the full form Register.view type just the short form r or R
G1662226  X Instead of the full form Data.List type just the short form d.l or D.L
G1623984  X The softkeys are below the command line. The camel casing (i.e. upper and lower case letters) on any softkey tells you the full form of a command. The softkeys guide you through the command input, displaying all possible commands and parameters.
G1584896  X Example - To assemble the Data.dump command using the softkeys:
G1624165  X Click Data.
G1624178  X Click dump.
G1624094  X Type the <range> or <address> you want to dump. For example, 0x1000--0x2000
G1624095  X Click [ok] to execute the command. The Data.dump window opens.
G1679140  H Single Stepping
G1679141  X The basic debug commands are available via the Run menu, the toolbar of the Data.List window, the main toolbar, and via the TRACE32 command line.
G1681888  X Single stepping  is one of the basic debug commands.
G1682397  X TRACE32 provides also more complex debug control commands. You can run or step until an expression changes or becomes true.
G1722910  X Example: Var.Step.Till i>11. single-steps the program until the variable i becomes greater than 11. The trailing dot is very important! It is the dot that formats 11 as a decimal number.
G1723011  X Note: i>11. is equivalent to i>0xB
G1715089  H Window Captions - What makes them special in TRACE32
G1715090  X The command with which you open a window will be shown as the window caption. The parameters and options are also included in the window caption.
G1715102  X You can re-insert a command from a window caption (a) into the command line (b) in order to modify the command. Lets do this with the Register window.
G1715117  X Choose View menu > Register.
G1715118  X Right-click the window caption (a).
G1715119  X Modify the command, e.g. by adding the /SpotLight option: It will highlight changed registers.
G1715120  X Click [ok] to execute the modified command.
G1715272  X Click  Single Step on the TRACE32 toolbar. Changed registers are highlighted immediately.
G1572855  H Memory
G1571255  H Displaying Memory
G1593881  X To display a memory dump in a Data.dump window, do one of the following:
G1636266  X Choose View menu > Dump,
G1636270  X or click  Memory Dump on the toolbar,
G1636271  X or, at the TRACE32 command line, type: Data.dump You can also specify an address or symbol directly, e.g.: Data.dump main++0x30
G1607413  X In the Data.dump dialog, enter the data item, e.g. main
G1606615  X Alternatively, select the HLL check box, and then click  to browse through the symbol database.
G1594370  X In the Browse Symbols window, double-click the symbol flags to select it, and then click OK.
G1606695  X In the following screenshot, the Data.dump window is called via the TRACE32 command line.
G1676011  X There are different ways to define an address range:
G1676012  X <start address>--<end address>
G1676224  E Data.dump SD:0x5530--SD:0x554F ;SD: is a memory class specifier
G1676013  X <start address>++<offset>
G1676193  E Data.dump cstr1++20. /Byte ;start at cstr1 plus the next 20 bytes
G1710770  E Data.dump cstr1--(cstr1+20.) /Byte  ;alternative to previous line
G1656719  H Modifying Memory
G1571294  X In a Data.dump window, double-click the value you want to modify.  A Data.Set command for the selected address is displayed in the command line. The short form of the command is D.S or d.s
G1684909  X Enter the new value directly after %LE, and then confirm with [ok].
G1614271  H Debugging the Program
G1614275  X Choose View menu > List Source.
G1604184  X A Data.List window opens, displaying the program listing around the program counter.
G1571450  X Do one of the following to single-step through the program:
G1571451  X Choose Run menu > Step,
G1571452  X or press F2 (see function keys in the Run menu),
G1718208  X or click  Single Step on the TRACE32 toolbar,
G1718214  X or click  Step in the Data.List window,
G1718215  X or, at the TRACE32 command line, type: Step
G1613877  X Take a look at the state line at the bottom of the TRACE32 main window:
G1633369  X The state line tells you:
G1633375  X A.
G1633377  X The (symbolic) address of the current cursor position in the active window. The current cursor position is highlighted in blue.
G1685268  X The program counter (PC) is highlighted in gray.
G1633381  X B.
G1633383  X The state of the debugger: stopped means your application program is stopped. You can now, for example, inspect or change memory.
G1633387  X C.
G1633389  X The state line displays the currently selected debug mode: The code display will be HLL(High Level Language) or ASM (assembler) or a MIXed mode with HLL and its corresponding assembler mnemonic.
G1609135  X On the toolbar of the Data.List window, click  Mode to toggle the debug mode to HLL.
G1610457  X Click  Step.  The step you are taking is a high-level-language step to the next HLL line.
G1611378  X Click  Mode again to toggle the debug mode to MIX.
G1685583  X Click  Step.  This time, the step executes one assembler line.
G1610519  X Right-click a code line, and then select Go Till.  The program execution starts. It stops when the program reaches the selected code line.
G1688996  H Displaying the Nesting of Functions
G1688997  X For the following example, lets assume we have a nesting of functions:  main() calls func2() and func2() calls func1():
G1571539  X Choose Var menu > Show Stack. The Frame.view window displays the function nesting.
G1674505  X The /Locals option shows the local variables of each function.
G1674513  X The /Caller option shows a few Ccode lines to indicate where the function was called.
G1689214  X This screenshot corresponds to the nesting and calling sequence shown above.
G1637469  H Breakpoints
G1637470  X Breakpoints are one of the most frequently used debug features.
G1573563  H Setting Software Breakpoints
G1689334  X Lets set breakpoints on primz and anzahl++
G1637341  X Double-click a code line to set a program breakpoint.
G1637342  X Make sure to click the white space in the code line, and not the code literal.
G1637343  X All code lines with a program breakpoint are marked with a red vertical bar.
G1573583  H Listing all Breakpoints
G1638900  X Choose Break menu > List to list all breakpoints.  The Break.List window opens, providing an overview of the existing breakpoints.
G1678574  X A.
G1678576  X Hex address of the breakpoint
G1678580  X B.
G1678582  X Breakpoint type
G1678586  X C.
G1678588  X Breakpoint implementation: SOFTware, ONCHIP or DISABLED.
G1678589  X A gray bar in a Data.List window indicates a DISABLED breakpoint.
G1678593  X D.
G1678595  X Code line of the breakpoint. Examples:
G1678596  X func2\6 means HLL line 6 in func2.
G1678597  X func2\13+0x8 means HLL line 13 in func2 + 8 bytes  (useful in debug mode MIX only).
G1649400  X On the toolbar, click  Go to start the program execution.
G1659409  X If the program does not reach your breakpoint, click  Break to stop the program execution.
G1573616  H Setting a Program Breakpoint to Any Code Line within a Function
G1671965  X Lets set a breakpoint to anzahl = 0 in function sieve().
