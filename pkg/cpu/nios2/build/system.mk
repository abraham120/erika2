# This makefile is included into the top level makefile for system library
# projects. It is responsible for defining the rules used to build the project.
#
# In practice this file defers the rule definitions to the included file, 
# system_rules.mk. This makefile restricts itself to simply configuring some
# variables required by system_rules.mk, and including the makefile fragments
# supplied by each component.
#
# The key feature of this makefile is that it includes the auto-generated
# makefile, generated_all.mk, to obtain a list of the components to build into
# the library. This file defines four lists of components being used,
# which are combined here to form the COMPONENTS variable.
#
# COMPONENTS is then used to construct: the source search path, the include 
# search path, and a list of the makefile fragments supplied by the components 
# (which are then included).

# Construct the source searchpath. There is a strict ordering here which is:

# 1. current project,
# 2. all components other than the HAL component,
# 3. the HAL component.
#
# This ordering allows the processor component to override the generic HAL in 
# order to provide the processor port of the HAL. The user can then override 
# this with files in their own directory. For example, this allows the user to 
# supply their own device drivers to replace those provided by default by the 
# components.
#
# This construction of the search path uses wildcard expansion to ensure that
# only those directories that exist make it onto the search path, which 
# improves build time.
