Altera compile structure
------------------------

Each project when compiled has a few directories that are handled by
Altera:

application.stf
  Seems related to the configuartion of the project
  Seems to say "this project is handled by altera and uses this system library"

- Debug
  - .elf and .flash 
    generated by the make process

  - generated_app.sh 
    sh script tthat contains SYSTEM_CONFIG_DIR that points to the debug dir

  - subdir.mk 
    for each directory adds the source names with a relative
    path to the main project dir (defines C_SRCS, CXX_SRCS, ASM_SRCS)

  - obj
    for each directory there is the object file and the dependency
    that contains something like obj/file.c : file.h .....

  - makefile
    setta parametri avri e chiama app.mk nella directory del componente altera_hal

- Binary
  Contains the ELF file
