Stack computation for ARM7
---------------------------

Example board: ARM Evaluator7T

register saved by a context change WITH STACK CHANGE: (r4-r11 = 32 bytes)
(1 for each stack)

register saved by the IRQ: 8 (r0-r3, r12, lr, lr_irq, spsr_irq = 32 bytes)
(1 for each task that can be at the same time on the stack)

space needed for the IRQ stub: 8 registers = 32 bytes
(1 system-wide)

space needed for the IRQ stack: stack needed by each function + 8 registers for each IRQ that can be stacked
(1 for each IRQ nesting level)
