/*******************************************************************************
  Function:	
    void WF_CMConnect(UINT8 CpId)

  Summary:
    Commands the MRF24WB0M to start a connection.

  Description:
    Directs the Connection Manager to scan for and connect to a WiFi network.
    This function does not wait until the connection attempt is successful, but 
    returns immediately.  See WF_ProcessEvent for events that can occur as a 
    result of a connection attempt being successful or not.

    Note that if the Connection Profile being used has WPA or WPA2 security
    enabled and is using a passphrase, the connection manager will first 
    calculate the PSK key, and then start the connection process.  The key 
    calculation can take up to 30 seconds.

  Precondition:
    MACInit must be called first.

  Parameters:
    CpId -- If this value is equal to an existing Connection Profile’s ID than 
            only that Connection Profile will be used to attempt a connection to 
            a WiFi network.  
            If this value is set to WF_CM_CONNECT_USING_LIST then the 
            connectionProfileList will be used to connect, starting with the 
            first Connection Profile in the list.

  Returns:
    None.
  	
  Remarks:
    None.

  Summary:
    Commands the MRF24WB0M to close any open connections and/or to cease

  Description:
    Directs the Connection Manager to close any open connection or connection 
    attempt in progress.  No further attempts to connect are taken until 
    WF_CMConnect() is called.  Generates the event 
    WF_EVENT_CONNECTION_PERMANENTLY_LOST when the connection is successfully
