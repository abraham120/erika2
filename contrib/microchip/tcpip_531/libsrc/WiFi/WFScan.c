  Function:	
    void WF_Scan(UINT8 CpId)

  Summary:
    Commands the MRF24WB0M to start a scan operation.  This will generate the 
    WF_EVENT_SCAN_RESULTS_READY event.

  Description:
    Directs the MRF24WB0M to initiate a scan operation utilizing the input 
    Connection Profile ID.  The Host Application will be notified that the scan 
    results are ready when it receives the WF_EVENT_SCAN_RESULTS_READY event.  
    The eventInfo field for this event will contain the number of scan results.  
    Once the scan results are ready they can be retrieved with 
    WF_ScanGetResult().

    Scan results are retained on the MRF24WB0M until:
    1.	Calling WF_Scan() again (after scan results returned from previous 
         call).
    2.	MRF24WB0M reset.

  Precondition:
  	MACInit must be called first.

  Parameters:
    CpId -- Connection Profile to use.  
            If the CpId is valid then the values from that Connection Profile 
            will be used for filtering scan results.  If the CpId is set to 
            WF_SCAN_ALL (0xFF) then a default filter will be used.

            Valid CpId :
            * If CP has a defined SSID only scan results with that SSID are 
               retained.  
            * If CP does not have a defined SSID then all scanned SSID’s will be 
               retained
            * Only scan results from Infrastructure or AdHoc networks are 
               retained, depending on the value of networkType in the Connection Profile
            * The channel list that is scanned will be determined from 
               channelList in the Connection Algorithm (which must be defined 
               before calling this function).

            CpId is equal to WF_SCAN_ALL:
            * All scan results are retained (both Infrastructure and Ad Hoc 
               networks).
            * All channels within the MRF24WB0M’s regional domain will be 
               scanned.
            * No Connection Profiles need to be defined before calling this 
               function.
            * The Connection Algorithm does not need to be defined before 
               calling this function.

  Returns:
  	None.
  	
  Remarks:
  	None.

  Function:	
    void WF_ScanGetResult(UINT8 listIndex, tWFScanResult  *p_scanResult)

  Summary:
    Read scan results back from MRF24WB0M.

  Description:
    After a scan has completed this function is used to read one or more of the 
    scan results from the MRF24WB0M.  The scan results will be written 
    contiguously starting at p_scanResults (see tWFScanResult structure for 
    format of scan result).    

  Precondition:
  	MACInit must be called first.  WF_EVENT_SCAN_RESULTS_READY event must have
    already occurrerd.

  Parameters:
    listIndex -- index (0-based list) of the scan entry to retrieve.
    p_scanResult -- pointer to location to store the scan result structure

  Returns:
  	None.
  	
  Remarks:
  	None.
