This test case test that the IRQ handler behaves in the correct way
when calling EE_hal_IRQ_stacked at the end of an ISR2.

To test this condition, I used the FP kernel and the semaphores.

Basically a thread starts and then stops on a semaphore. when the IRQ
arrives, the thread is unlocked, and must execute.

On old arm7tdmi kernels, the stack change did not work in the proper
way, and the main was dispatched instead of the unlocked thread.
