This directory contains a set of examples,
packages, architectur ports, boards which
have been discontinued over the past months.

For the pkg content, please note that the 
various CPUs and boards does not compile
from the old directory. You will need to move
them into the pkg directory, and then to update
the code base, as it has not been updated
recently. However, please consider
these files as a starting base to make a
working environment.
