/*
 * A minimal EE demo that demonstrates how to work with the MULTISTACK mode and
 * semaphores.
 * In this demo two tasks are activated in the main function and work with
 * different stacks.
 * The demo is a classical producer/consumer problem implemented with two
 * semaphores P and V.
 * The demo is used to show the following features of ERIKA Enterprise OS: 
 * - 	Multistack configuration: The Producer and the Consumer task need a
 * 	separate stack because they block calling the WaitSem primitive. 
 *
 * - 	Separate stack for IRQs: the OIL file allocates a separate stack for
 * 	ISR Type 2 by setting: "IRQ_STACK = TRUE { SYS_SIZE=64; };".
 *
 * - 	Semaphores: ERIKA Enterprise supports counting semaphores.
 * 	The demo show how to initialize the semaphores, and how to use the main
 *	semaphore primitives (PostSem and WaitSem).
 *
