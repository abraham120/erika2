 Can Calibration Protocol (CCP) demo

 <long_descr>
 CCP_demo: A minimal CCP demo using MPC5643L evaluation board.
 The voltage in the potentiometer output of the Evaluation Board can be
 monitored by using CCP. A correct sequence of CCP commands can be found
 in readme.txt file.
 Another useful resource is the file "PCAN_CCP_TEST_LEOPARD_ADC.xmt".
 This is a PCAN-View profile configuration to send ALL CCP command necessary
 to test the demo. The implementation of CCP provided by the ECU is also
 supported by and succesfully tested under other CCP commercial tools.
 The demo uses the following peripherals: ADC, PWM, CAN and CTU
 The demo is configured as OSEK BCC1 kernel.
 To test this demo, simply connect CAN_H channel of the Leopard evaluation
 board to your favorite CAN-dongle on your PC and then send the sequence
 of CCP commands shown in readme.txt file present in this folder. The
 START_STOP command of such sequence enables "sample and send" on a variable
 located at 0x40000010 (check WRITE_DAQ command for details). This variable
 holds the tensione measured at potentiometer output (expressed in mV).
 Furthermore, this demo shows the use of PWM and ADC driven by the CTU module.
