 * Description of how to run the demo:
 *   1) Connect the ethernet port of the programmed demo board to a 
 *        computer either directly or through a router.
 *   2) Determine the IP address of the demo board.  This can be done several
 *        different ways.
 *      a) If you are using a demo setup with an LCD display (e.g. Explorer 16
 *           or PICDEM.net 2), the IP address should be displayed on the second
 *           line of the display.
 *      b) Open the Microchip Ethernet Device Discoverer from the start menu.
 *           Press the "Discover Devices" button to see the addresses and host
 *           names of all devices with the Announce Protocol enabled on your
 *           network.  You may have to configure your computer's firewall to 
 *           prevent it from blocking UDP port 30303 for this solution.
 *      c) If your board is connected directly with your computer with a
 *           crossover cable: 
 *              1) Open a command/DOS prompt and type 'ipconfig'.  Find the 
 *                   network adaptor that is connected to the board.  The IP
 *                   address of the board is located in the 'Default Gateway'
 *                   field
 *              2) Open up the network status for the network adaptor that
 *                   connects the two devices.  This can be done by right clicking
 *                   on the network connection icon in the network settings folder 
 *                   and select 'status' from the menu. Find the 'Default Gateway'
 *                   field.
 *   3) Open a command/DOS prompt.  Type "telnet ip_address 9760" where
 *        ip_address is the IP address that you got from step 2.
 *   4) As you type characters, they will be echoed back in your command prompt
 *        window in UPPER CASE.
 *   5) Press Escape to end the demo.

  Function:
	void GenericTCPServer(void)

  Summary:
	Implements a simple ToUpper TCP Server.

  Description:
	This function implements a simple TCP server.  The function is invoked
	periodically by the stack to listen for incoming connections.  When a 
	connection is made, the server reads all incoming data, transforms it
	to uppercase, and echos it back.
	
	This example can be used as a model for many TCP server applications.

  Precondition:
	TCP is initialized.

  Parameters:
	None

  Returns:
  	None
