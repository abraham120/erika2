/*
 * Simple project to test the AUTOSAR SPI Handler/Driver:
 * - 2 Sequence
 *   - Interruptible Sequence
 *     - 2 Jobs
 *       - 4 Channels 
 *       - 7 Channels
 *   - Non-Interruptible Sequence
 *      - 1 Job
 *      - 3 Channels
 * - Only 2 SSI Hardware Unit
 *   - Asynchronous
 *   - Loop-back Mode
 * - Write/AsyncTransmit/Read (IB)
 *   - Polling Mode ( to test internal scheduler )
 * - Setup/AsyncTransmit (EB)
