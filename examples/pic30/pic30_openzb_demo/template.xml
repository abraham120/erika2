 <long_descr>
 This demo is a self running application of IEEE 802.15.4. The cordinator and the end device 
 communicate some useful measurements which are displayed on the LCD : 
 a) number of packets sent;   
 b) number of loss packets;
 c) number of corrupted packets.

 These measurements helps to understand the nature of the environment where the devices are deployed.  

 WARNING: the application code is the same for coordinator and end-device. To select the device type make the appropriate change in the conf.oil
