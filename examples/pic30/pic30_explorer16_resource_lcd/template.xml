 <long_descr>
 This small demo shows the usage of Resources by displaying characters
 on an LCD. The demo uses the fact that every access to the LCD is not
 atomic, and it is composed by two commands, the first one which
 selects the column and the row of the LCD, the second command which
 prints a character.
 &lt;br&gt;
 The usefulness of using the resources is highlighted by the fact that
 they can avoid race conditions, which result in the demo with a
 display of 3 characters instead of two.
 &lt;bt&gt;
 The demo uses the LCD of the Microchip Explorer16 Evaluation Board.
